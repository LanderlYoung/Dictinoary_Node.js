Dictinoary\_Node.js
==================
youdao dictionary wrapped in Node.js

Youdao dictionary is a good online dictionary.After learn something about awesome Node.js, I'd like use Node.js as a native javascript translator. So, I came up whith the idea that write a javascript script whose job is send query request to [dict.youdao.com](http://dict.youdao.com) and show result in terminal,  to be more awesome,  make it be able to pronounce!

###INSTALL
to install this tool, just simply move dict.js and pnc.js into some directory, and create a executable soft link of dict.js. At last, at the same times , the most important step, change the pnc\_js\_Path variable of dict.js to the absolute path of pnc.js.

this is the test branch.
testing different kind of Node.js API, and some other things.

###dependence:
#### [must]
node.js module `xmlreader` which could be installed (and already installed in current directory) by `npm install xmlreader`.

#### [alternative]
**in order to be able to prounounce, the following software is required.**  

sox music player, which could be installed by `sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all` or `sudo yum install sox libsox-fmt-all`.
