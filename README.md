Dictinoary_Node.js
==================
youdao dictionary wrapped in Node.js

Youdao dictionary is a good online dictionary.After learn something about awesome Node.js, I'd like use Node.js as a native javascript translator. So, I came up whith the idea that write a javascript script whose job is send query request to [dict.youdao.com](http://dict.youdao.com) and show result in terminal,  to be more awesome,  make it be able to pronounce!
