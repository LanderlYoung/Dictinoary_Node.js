Dictinoary\_Node.js
==================
youdao dictionary wrapped in Node.js

Youdao dictionary is a good online dictionary.After learn something about awesome Node.js, I'd like use Node.js as a native javascript translator. So, I came up whith the idea that write a javascript script whose job is send query request to [dict.youdao.com](http://dict.youdao.com) and show result in terminal,  to be more awesome,  make it be able to pronounce!

this is the test branch.
testing different kind of Node.js API, and some other things.

dependence:
### [must]
node.js module `xmlreader` which could be installed (and already installed in current directory) by `npm install xmlreader`.

### [alternative]
### in order to be able to prounounce, the following software is required.
sox music player, which could be installed by `sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all` or `sudo yum install sox libsox-fmt-all`.
